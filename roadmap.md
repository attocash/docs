# Roadmap

*Redefining Cryptocurrency as a True Currency*

Welcome to the journey of **Atto**, where we are committed to bringing cryptocurrency back to its original purpose—a
medium of exchange that is accessible, efficient, and truly functional as a currency. Below is our roadmap outlining the
upcoming phases and initiatives we are excited to share with our community.

### Network Explorer Release

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming release of the **Atto Network Explorer**. This tool will provide real-time
visibility into all network transactions and activities, improving transparency and allowing users to monitor the health
and performance of the Atto network.

### Faucet and Wallet Enhancements

Our team is working diligently to make the **Atto Faucet** and **Wallet** robust and user-friendly.

Originally, we planned to develop native Android and iOS wallet applications. After careful consideration and initial development efforts, we’ve concluded our mobile app approach. We’re now pivoting toward a **Web Wallet** solution to provide a more unified and accessible experience.

### Introducing the Atto Web Wallet

- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Users will be able to access the Atto Wallet from any modern web browser, removing
  the need for separate native apps.
- **Unified Codebase**: Streamlined development and maintenance, ensuring faster feature updates and security patches.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Designed with simplicity and performance in mind, the Web Wallet will offer a consistent
  interface across devices.

## Phase 3: Miner ✅

Atto remains committed to a fast and green cryptocurrency model and will not compromise on that principle. Traditional
mining is not only wasteful but also largely unnecessary to achieve network security. Instead, our "miner" utilizes
[folding@home](https://foldingathome.org), ensuring that electricity goes into meaningful computations that aid scientific research rather than being
wasted on repetitive hashing. This approach is inspired by Banano and aligns with our vision of a sustainable and
community-driven cryptocurrency.

## Phase 4: Full Atto Launch

### Transition from Beta Stage to Official Release

With the platform stabilized and mobile apps launched, we will officially unveil Atto to the world. This milestone

who contribute positively.

- **Performance-Based Scoring**: Representatives will be evaluated on transaction confirmation speed and frequency.
- **Hourly Rewards**: Awards distributed every hour, proportional to voting weight and capped at 1%.
- **Transparency**: Clear criteria and real-time performance metrics will be available to all participants.

### How to Get Involved
