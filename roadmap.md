Welcome to the journey of **Atto**, where we are committed to bringing cryptocurrency back to its original purpose—a

upcoming phases and initiatives we are excited to share with our community.

## Phase 0: Pre Release ✅

### Network Explorer Release

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming release of the **Atto Network Explorer**. This tool will provide real-time
visibility into all network transactions and activities, improving transparency and allowing users to monitor the health

## Phase 2: Mobile Wallet Releases ✅

Originally, we planned to develop native Android and iOS wallet applications. After careful consideration and initial
development efforts, we’ve concluded our mobile app approach. We’re now pivoting toward a **Web Wallet** solution to
provide a more unified and accessible experience.

### Introducing the Atto Web Wallet

- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Users will be able to access the Atto Wallet from any modern web browser, removing
  the need for separate native apps.
- **Unified Codebase**: Streamlined development and maintenance, ensuring faster feature updates and security patches.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Designed with simplicity and performance in mind, the Web Wallet will offer a consistent
  interface across devices.

## Phase 3: Miner ✅

Atto remains committed to a fast and green cryptocurrency model and will not compromise on that principle. Traditional
mining is not only wasteful but also largely unnecessary to achieve network security. Instead, our "miner" utilizes
[folding@home](https://foldingathome.org), ensuring that electricity goes into meaningful computations that aid
scientific research rather than being wasted on repetitive hashing. This approach is inspired by Banano and aligns with
our vision of a sustainable and community-driven cryptocurrency.

## Phase 4: Atto Full Launch ✅

### Transition from Pre-Release Stage to Official Release

After running for several months, we are now confident that Atto is ready for a broader audience. With the platform
stabilized and the web wallet successfully launched, we officially unveiled Atto to a bigger audience.

</details>

## Phase 5: Integration

### API Wallet ✅

We're currently developing an API Wallet to make integrating with the Atto network seamless. This will allow developers
and services to interact with the network effortlessly, paving the way for broader adoption and listings.

### Listings ✅

We're actively working on getting Atto listed on key platforms to increase visibility and accessibility. Listings will
make it easier for users to discover, trade, and adopt Atto across various ecosystems.

### Educational Resources (In Progress)

To assist new users, we will provide:

- **Comprehensive Guides**: Step-by-step instructions on how to integrate Atto.
- **FAQs and Support**: Answers to common questions and dedicated support channels.

### Node Metrics  ✅

- **Expose Node Metrics**: Implement prometheus endpoint so node operators can monitor the health and performance of
  their nodes.

## Phase 6: Representative Program Introduction

### Network Metrics

To enhance network transparency and provide valuable insights, we will:

- **Launch a Network Dashboard**: Display key live metrics on our website, such as block count, transactions per
  second (TPS), inflation, activity, and other popular network statistics.

### Empowering Network Participants

We are introducing the **Atto Representative Program**, designed to enhance network efficiency and reward participants
who contribute positively.

- **Performance-Based Scoring**: Representatives will be evaluated on transaction confirmation speed and frequency.
- **Hourly Rewards**: Awards distributed every hour, proportional to voting weight and capped at 1%.
- **Transparency**: Clear criteria and real-time performance metrics will be available to all participants.

### How to Get Involved

- **Become a Representative**: Instructions will be provided on how to set up and optimize your node.
- **Maximize Your Impact**: Tips on improving performance and increasing your contribution to the network.

## Phase 7: Micropayments

We will introduce a payment protocol and browser extension to enable seamless micropayments across the web.

- **Atto Payment Protocol**: A simple, open protocol for requesting and confirming payments.
- **Self-Hosted Server**: A reference implementation that can be run by merchants or developers.
- **Browser Extension**: A lightweight plugin to allow users to approve and send payments directly from their browser.
