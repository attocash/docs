# Offline Signing with Atto Commons

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate with the Atto network at a low level using the **Atto Commons**
libraries (available for JavaScript/TypeScript and Kotlin). This approach allows you to generate and manage keys,
construct transactions offline, and interact directly with an Atto node – all without relying on the Wallet Server
component. This is ideal for advanced integrators (such as exchanges or custodians) who require full control over key
management and offline signing.

**Note:** Atto uses Ed25519 elliptic curve cryptography for its account keys and signatures. This means you can leverage
third-party tools or HSMs for key derivation and signing if desired. In this guide, however, we will use the Atto
Commons library for all key and transaction operations for consistency and simplicity.

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to the following components in your environment:

* An **Atto Historical Node** (with its REST API endpoint) connected to the main network.
* An **Atto Work Server** for generating the Proof-of-Work required by transactions.

Typically, integrators will run their own historical node and work server. For testing, you may use Atto's public
endpoints (available upon request). In the code examples below, we will use the main network configuration.


## Installation

Make sure the Atto Commons libraries are available in your project:

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```bash
    npm i @attocash/commons-js
    ````

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    implementation("cash.atto:commons-node-remote:$commonsVersion")
    implementation("cash.atto:commons-worker-remote:$commonsVersion")
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Key Generation and Derivation

The first step is to generate a private key for your Atto account. The Atto Commons library provides utilities for
secure key generation. In JavaScript, you can use `AttoPrivateKey.generate()` to create a new random key. In Kotlin, a
similar `AttoPrivateKey.generate()` function (via the companion object) is available. You can also import an existing
private key from a hex string if you have one (for example, from a mnemonic or another source).

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```javascript
    import {AttoPrivateKey, fromHexToByteArray, toSignerJs} from '@attocash/commons-js';

    // Generate a new random private key
    const newPrivateKey = AttoPrivateKey.Companion.generate();
    console.log("Generated Private Key:", toHex(newPrivateKey.value));

    // (Optional) Import a private key from a known hex string
    const hexKey = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
    const importedPrivateKey = new AttoPrivateKey(fromHexToByteArray(hexKey));
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    import cash.atto.commons.* // hypothetical import, adjust as needed

    // Generate a new random private key
    val newPrivateKey = AttoPrivateKey.generate()
    println("Generated Private Key: ${newPrivateKey.toHex()}")

    // (Optional) Import a private key from a known hex string
    val hexKey = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    val importedPrivateKey = AttoPrivateKey(hexKey.hexToByteArray())
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**About Key Security:** The private key is a 32-byte value. Keep this safe! With Ed25519, the public key can be derived
from the private key, and the Atto address can be derived from the public key. If you prefer to derive keys from a
mnemonic seed, ensure you use a secure, Atto-compatible method. (Atto Commons supports seed generation as well, though
it’s not shown here.)

## Address Generation

Once you have a private key (and its corresponding public key), you can create an **Atto Address**. An Atto address is
analogous to an account identifier on the network. It encodes the public key (and a checksum), along with a prefix that
indicates the algorithm. Atto Commons makes address creation straightforward: you provide the algorithm (
currently `AttoAlgorithm.V1` for Ed25519-based addresses) and the public key, and it returns the address object.

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```javascript
    import {AttoAddress, AttoAlgorithm, toSignerJs} from '@attocash/commons-js';

    // Assume we have a private key (e.g., importedPrivateKey from previous section)
    const signer = toSignerJs(importedPrivateKey); // create a signer from the private key
    const publicKey = signer.publicKey; // get the Ed25519 public key
    const address = new AttoAddress(AttoAlgorithm.V1, publicKey); // derive the Atto address (V1 algorithm)
    console.log("Address:", address.toString());
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    import cash.atto.commons.*

    val signer = newPrivateKey.toSigner() // create a signer from the private key (hypothetical extension)
    val publicKey = signer.publicKey // obtain the Ed25519 public key (ByteArray)
    val address = AttoAddress(AttoAlgorithm.V1, publicKey)
    println("Address: $address")
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The resulting address (when printed) will be a string starting with the `atto://` prefix. This address is what you share to receive funds.

**Choosing a Representative:** Every Atto account can designate a representative. In most cases, you can use your own voting node as its
representative or use a default Atto representative.

## Setting Up Network Client and Work Server

To interact with the network, you need a client to communicate with an Atto node’s REST API, and a worker to compute
Proof-of-Work (PoW). The Atto Commons library can create these for you:

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```javascript
    import {createCustomAttoNodeClient, createAttoWorker, AttoNetwork} from '@attocash/commons-js';

    // Configure network and endpoints (using mainnet in this example)
    const client = createCustomAttoNodeClient(
    AttoNetwork.LIVE, // target the main Atto network
    "https://my-historical-node.mydomain.cash" // base URL of your historical node's REST API
    );

    const worker = createAttoWorker(
    "https://my-work-server.mydomain.cash" // base URL of a work server for PoW
    );
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    import cash.atto.commons.*

    val client = AttoNodeOperations.custom(
    AttoNetwork.LIVE, // target the main Atto network
    "https://my-historical-node.mydomain.cash" // base URL of your historical node's REST API
    ) {}

    val worker = AttoWorker.remote(
    "https://my-work-server.mydomain.cash" // base URL of a work server for PoW
    )
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make sure the URLs point to your own infrastructure or trusted public endpoints. The node client will be used for
querying the blockchain state (accounts, transactions) and broadcasting signed transactions. The work server will be
used to compute the small PoW required for each transaction block (Atto uses a micro-hash for spam prevention instead of
fees).

## Reading Account State

Before crafting transactions, it’s important to retrieve the current state of your accounts (balance and height). The *
*account height** is used to sequence transactions correctly (each new block on an account increments the height).

Using the node client, you can fetch account information for one or multiple addresses via
`client.account([...addresses])`. The result will include each account’s current balance, frontier (last block hash),
and height, among other data. We can store this in a map for quick lookup.

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```javascript
    // Prepare a list of addresses to monitor (in this example, our hot wallet and another account)
    const addressesToMonitor = [hotWalletAddress, anotherAddress];
    const accountsInfo = await client.account(addressesToMonitor);

    // Create a map of address -> account info for easy reference
    const accountMap = new Map(accountsInfo.map(acc => [acc.address.toString(), acc]));

    // Example: print the current balance and height of the hot wallet
    const hotWalletInfo = accountMap.get(hotWalletAddress.toString());
    if (hotWalletInfo) {
    console.log("Hot Wallet Balance:", hotWalletInfo.balance.toString());
    console.log("Hot Wallet Height:", hotWalletInfo.height.toString());
  }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    val addressesToMonitor = listOf(hotWalletAddress, anotherAddress)
    val accountsInfo = client.account(addressesToMonitor) // suspend function or similar returning account info list

    // Create a map from address string to account info
    val accountMap = accountsInfo.associateBy {it.address.toString()}.toMutableMap()

    // Example: print current balance and height for the hot wallet
    accountMap[hotWalletAddress.toString()]?.let {account ->
    println("Hot Wallet Balance: ${info.balance}")
    println("Hot Wallet Height: ${info.height}")
  }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If an address has never received any funds (and thus has no account entry on the ledger yet), the `client.account` call
will return no entry for it. In our example, `anotherAddress` might be a brand new address (no
funds yet), so it would not appear in `accountsInfo`. We handle this by checking `existingAccount == null` later when
receiving funds.

## Receiving Incoming Transactions (Opening / Receiving)

One crucial aspect of integration is handling incoming funds to your addresses. In Atto, incoming funds arrive as
**receivable** blocks (similar to pending transactions). To actually claim the funds, the receiving account must publish
a corresponding block: an **open block** if it’s the account’s first transaction, or a **receive block** for subsequent
ones.

The Commons library provides helper functions to generate these blocks easily. We can subscribe to receivable events
using `client.onReceivable(addresses, callback)` so that whenever someone sends Atto to one of our monitored addresses,
we get notified and can immediately pocket the funds.

Below, we set up a subscription for receivables and define a `receiver()` callback that will:

* Look up the signer for the receiving address.
* Determine if the account already exists (opened) or not.
* Use `open` if no existing account (to create the open block with a representative), or `receive`
if the account exists (to create a normal receive block).
* Sign the block with our private key.
* Request PoW from the work server.
* Publish the completed transaction to the network via the node client.
* Update our local `accountMap` with the new account state.

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```javascript
    import {attoAccountOpen, attoAccountReceive, AttoHeight} from '@attocash/commons-js';

    const signerMap = new Map([
    [hotWalletAddress.toString(), hotWalletSigner],
    [anotherAddress.toString(), anotherSigner]
    ]);

    // Define the callback to handle incoming receivables
    const receiver = async (receivable) => {
    console.log("Receivable detected:", receivable);
    const receiverAddr = receivable.receiverAddress.toString();
    const signer = signerMap.get(receiverAddr);
    const existingAccount = accountMap.get(receiverAddr);

    // Build the appropriate block (open or receive)
    let result;
    if (existingAccount == null) {
    // If account not opened yet, create an open block with a representative
    result = attoAccountOpen(AttoNetwork.LIVE, representativeAddress, receivable, client.now().toString());
  } else {
    // If account exists, create a receive block
    result = attoAccountReceive(existingAccount, receivable, client.now().toString());
  }
    const {block, account} = result;

    // Sign the block with the account's private key
    const signature = await signer.signBlock(block);
    // Compute Proof-of-Work for the block
    const work = await worker.workBlock(block);
    // Create the finalized transaction
    const transaction = new AttoTransaction(block, signature, work);

    // Publish the transaction to the network
    await client.publish(transaction);
    console.log("Published receive block for", receiverAddr);

    // Update our local account state map
    accountMap.set(receiverAddr, account);
  };

    // Start listening for receivables on our addresses
    const receivableSubscription = client.onReceivable(
    [hotWalletAddress, anotherAddress],
    receiver,
    errorMsg => console.error("Receivable stream closed/error:", errorMsg)
    );
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    val signerMap = mapOf(
    hotWalletAddress.toString() to hotWalletSigner,
    anotherAddress.toString() to anotherSigner
    )

    // Callback to handle an incoming receivable
    suspend fun onReceivable(receivable: Receivable) {
    println("Receivable detected: $receivable")
    val receiverAddr = receivable.receiverAddress.toString()
    val signer = signerMap[receiverAddr] ?: return
    val existingAccount = accountMap[receiverAddr]

    // Build open or receive block
    val (block, account) = if (existingAccount == null) {
    AttoAccount.open(AttoNetwork.LIVE, representativeAddress, receivable, client.now())
  } else {
    existingAccount.receive(receivable, client.now())
  }

    // Sign and compute PoW
    val signature = signer.signBlock(block)
    val work = worker.workBlock(block)
    val transaction = AttoTransaction(block, signature, work)

    // Publish the transaction
    client.publish(transaction)
    println("Published receive block for $receiverAddr")

    // Update local account state
    accountMap[receiverAddr] = account
  }

    // Subscribe to receivables (assuming client has coroutine or callback-based subscription)
    client.receivableStream(listOf(hotWalletAddress, anotherAddress)).collect {
    onReceivable(it)
  }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the above code, `now` is a timestamp retrieved from the node (e.g., via `client.now()`), used to timestamp the open
block. We also used a `representativeAddress` which we set earlier (in this example, we might use our voting node address
as the representative for new accounts).

**What’s Happening:** When someone sends funds to our address, the node’s receivable stream triggers. We create an
**open block** if this is the first time the address is receiving funds (which sets up the account with an initial
representative), or a **receive block** if the account already exists. We then sign it and solve PoW, and publish it to
incorporate the funds into our account. After publishing, the funds are confirmed in our account’s balance.

## Sending a Transaction

Sending Atto (e.g., processing a withdrawal) involves creating a **send block** on the sender’s account. The Atto
Commons `send` function will produce a new send block along with the updated account state. You then sign the block,
get PoW, and publish the transaction.

Important considerations before sending:

* The sending account must have a sufficient balance.
* You must use the correct current height of the account (the library handles this if you pass the latest
`existingAccount` object).
* Each send reduces the account’s balance and increases its height.

Below we craft a send from our `hotWalletAddress` to `anotherAddress` for an example amount of 100.1 ATTO. We assume `accountMap` has been kept up-to-date with the latest state of
`hotWalletAddress` (including any receives done above).

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```javascript
    import {attoAccountSend, AttoAmount, AttoUnit} from '@attocash/commons-js';

    // Define the amount to send (100.1 ATTO in this example)
    const amount = AttoAmount.Companion.from(AttoUnit.ATTO, "100.1");

    // Get the current account state for the sender
    const senderAccount = accountMap.get(hotWalletAddress.toString());
    if (!senderAccount) {
    throw new Error("Sender account not found or not opened.");
  }

    // Build the send block and updated account state
    const {block: sendBlock, account: updatedSenderAccount} =
    attoAccountSend(senderAccount, anotherAddress, amount);

    // Sign and compute PoW for the send block
    const sendSignature = await signerMap.get(hotWalletAddress.toString()).signBlock(sendBlock);
    const sendWork = await worker.work(sendBlock);

    // Create and publish the send transaction
    const sendTransaction = new AttoTransaction(sendBlock, sendSignature, sendWork);
    await client.publish(sendTransaction);
    console.log(`Sent ${amount} from ${hotWalletAddress} to ${anotherAddress}`);

    // Update the local account state for the sender
    accountMap.set(hotWalletAddress.toString(), updatedSenderAccount);
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    val amount = AttoAmount.from(AttoUnit.ATTO, "100.1")

    val senderAccount = accountMap[hotWalletAddress.toString()]
    ?: error("Sender account not found or not opened.")

    // Build the send block
    val (sendBlock, updatedSenderAccount) = senderAccount.send(anotherAddress, amount)

    // Sign and compute PoW
    val sendSignature = signerMap[hotWalletAddress.toString()]!!.signBlock(sendBlock)
    val sendWork = worker.work(sendBlock)

    // Create and publish the transaction
    val sendTransaction = AttoTransaction(sendBlock, sendSignature, sendWork)
    client.publish(sendTransaction)
    println("Sent $amount from $hotWalletAddress to $anotherAddress")

    // Update local sender account state
    accountMap[hotWalletAddress.toString()] = updatedSenderAccount
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After publishing the send, the funds will be deducted from the sender’s account on the ledger, and a corresponding
receivable will be waiting for the recipient (which, if it's one of our addresses and we have the receivable
subscription running as above, will trigger an automatic receive).

## Monitoring Account Activity (Transactions and Entries)

To facilitate real-time updates (e.g., for showing confirmations or new incoming transactions), the Atto node provides
streaming endpoints. We already used `receivable` for incoming pending funds. There are two other useful streams for
integrators:

* **Transaction Stream** – streams every new block (transaction) involving the specified accounts, starting from given heights.
* **Account Entry Stream** – streams every new account entry (state update) for the specified accounts, starting from given heights.

The difference between these streams is subtle but important. The **transaction stream** will emit on any new send or
receive block for your accounts as they are confirmed on the network. The **account entry stream** will emit an event
when an account’s state changes (for example, a new open block or any new block on the account). In practice, if you
track all your addresses from their latest heights, both streams will notify you of new blocks; you can choose which to
use based on the level of detail you need.

First, we build a `HeightSearch` object that tells the node from which height to start streaming for each account.
Typically, you start at the next height after the current one (or at height 0 for unopened accounts).

<Tabs groupId="library">
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

    ```javascript
    import {AccountHeightSearch, HeightSearch, AttoHeight} from '@attocash/commons-js';

    // Prepare height-based search for each address (start from current height + 1, or 0 if no account yet)
    function buildHeightSearch() {
    const searches = [];
    for (const addressStr of signerMap.keys()) {
    const accountInfo = accountMap.get(addressStr);
    const startHeight = (accountInfo == null)
    ? AttoHeight.Companion.MIN        // start at height 0 if account not opened
    : accountInfo.height.next();      // start from next height of existing account
    searches.push(new AccountHeightSearch(AttoAddress.Companion.parse(addressStr), startHeight));
  }
    return HeightSearch.Companion.fromArray(searches);
  }

    const heightSearch = buildHeightSearch();

    // Subscribe to transaction stream
    const transactionSubscription = client.onTransaction(
    heightSearch,
    tx => console.log("New transaction affecting our accounts:", tx),
    err => console.warn("Transaction stream closed/error:", err)
    );

    // Subscribe to account entry stream
    const accountEntrySubscription = client.onAccountEntry(
    heightSearch,
    entry => console.log("New account entry (state update):", entry),
    err => console.warn("Account entry stream closed/error:", err)
    );
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    fun buildHeightSearch(): HeightSearch {
    val searches = signerMap.keys.map {addressStr ->
    val accountInfo = accountMap[addressStr]
    val startHeight = accountInfo?.height?.next() ?: AttoHeight.MIN  // 0 if not opened, or next height
    AccountHeightSearch(AttoAddress.parse(addressStr), startHeight)
  }
    return HeightSearch.from(searches)
  }
    val heightSearch = buildHeightSearch()

    // Subscribe to transaction stream
    val transactionSubscription = client.transactionStream(heightSearch).collect {
    println("New transaction affecting our accounts: $it")
  }

    // Subscribe to account entry stream
    val accountEntrySubscription = client.accountEntryStream(heightSearch).collect {
    println("New account entry (state update): $it")
  }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This can be useful to update balances, show confirmations, or trigger internal accounting logic in real time. Remember
to handle the termination or errors of these streams (for example, re-establish them if needed, or clean up on application
shutdown).

## Conclusion

By using the Atto Commons library for JS or Kotlin, you can fully manage the lifecycle of Atto transactions in your own
code: from key creation and offline signing to publishing transactions on the network and reacting to incoming funds.
This **advanced integration** approach gives you maximum flexibility and security (you control your private keys at all
times) at the cost of a bit more implementation work compared to using a high-level Wallet Server.

Integrators should ensure they maintain the `accountMap` state accurately and securely store private keys. Additionally,
for production use, always run your own Atto node and work server for reliability and security. With the patterns shown
in this tutorial, you can build a robust integration that handles sending and receiving Atto programmatically, all while
keeping sensitive operations offline.
