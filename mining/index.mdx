# Mining

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmining‚Äù in the traditional sense.

Rather than securing the network with energy-intensive calculations, you can instead earn Atto by contributing your computer‚Äôs processing power to **medical research** through Folding@Home. This integration isn‚Äôt part of Atto‚Äôs consensus mechanism‚Äîit‚Äôs simply a practical way to reward users for **real-world** contributions. Each unit of work you complete benefits scientific studies and aligns with Atto‚Äôs mission of remaining **green and sustainable**.

By harnessing your computing power for good, we also gain a fair method to **distribute attos** to those who support meaningful research.

Here‚Äôs how to get set up:

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Folding@Home

If you haven‚Äôt already, download and install Folding@Home.

üîó [Official Folding@Home Installation & Account Guide](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/)

Make sure to create an account during the setup process if prompted, although for reward purposes, the key is setting the correct username and team number in the client later.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure Your Account

Once Folding@Home is installed:

1.  Open the Folding@Home Web Control (usually accessible via `http://localhost:7396` or `http://127.0.0.1:7396` in your browser, or via the F@H application interface).
2.  Click on **"Settings"**.
3.  Set the following:
* **Name**: Your Atto address **without** the `atto://` prefix

_Example:_ `atto://adwmbykpqs3mgbqogizzwm6arokkcmuxium7rbh343drwd2q5om6vj3jrfiyk`

‚û°Ô∏è Use: `adwmbykpqs3mgbqogizzwm6arokkcmuxium7rbh343drwd2q5om6vj3jrfiyk`
* **Team Number**: `1066107`
* **(Optional) Passkey**: You can obtain a passkey from Folding@Home to secure your username and potentially earn bonus points. Follow their instructions if desired.

4.  Click **"Save"**.
5.  Ensure Folding@Home is running (click the "Start Folding" button if it's stopped).

That‚Äôs all! Folding@Home will start processing work units, and your contributions will be linked to your Atto address automatically for reward distribution.

## üì§ How Rewards Are Distributed

The system checks for updated Folding@Home scores periodically. While this currently happens roughly **twice a day on average**, the exact timing can vary and **isn't guaranteed**.

Each time the system finds an update from folding@home api, it calculates the total rewards to distribute based on the time elapsed since the *last* update. The calculation works like this:

* **5,000 attos are allocated per minute.**
* If the system checks for updates after, say, 12 hours (720 minutes) since the last check, it will distribute a total of `5,000 √ó 720 = 3,600,000 attos` in that cycle.
* This total amount is then **divided proportionally** among team members based on the Folding@Home points they contributed during that specific period, as reported by the Folding@Home stats API.

So, if your machine contributed 10% of the total team score accumulated since the last reward distribution, you'll receive 10% of the total attos distributed in that cycle.

Your Atto address (used as your Folding@Home username) is what links your contributions to your wallet‚Äîso make sure it‚Äôs entered correctly!
