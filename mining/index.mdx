# Mining

> ⚠️ **Note:** This isn’t “mining” in the traditional sense.

Rather than securing the network with energy-intensive calculations, you can instead earn Atto by contributing your computer’s processing power to **medical research** through Folding@Home. This integration isn’t part of Atto’s consensus mechanism—it’s simply a practical way to reward users for **real-world** contributions. Each unit of work you complete benefits scientific studies and aligns with Atto’s mission of remaining **green and sustainable**.

By harnessing your computing power for good, we also gain a fair method to **distribute attos** to those who support meaningful research.

Here’s how to get set up:

## ✅ Step 1: Install Folding@Home

If you haven’t already, download and install Folding@Home.

🔗 [Official Folding@Home Installation & Account Guide](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/)

Make sure to create an account during the setup process.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Configure Your Account

Once Folding@Home is installed:

1. Open the Folding@Home Web Control.
1. Go to the **Account Settings** tab (top right).
1. Set the following:
    - **Username**: Your Atto address without the `atto://` prefix

    _Example:_ `atto://adwmbykpqs3mgbqogizzwm6arokkcmuxium7rbh343drwd2q5om6vj3jrfiyk`

    ➡️ Use: `adwmbykpqs3mgbqogizzwm6arokkcmuxium7rbh343drwd2q5om6vj3jrfiyk`
    - **Team Number**: `1066107`

    <IdealImage img={require('./example.jpg')} alt="Screen shot from folding@home." />

1. Click to start

That’s all! Folding@Home will start processing work units, and your contributions will be linked to your Atto address
automatically.

## 📤 How Rewards Are Distributed

Folding@Home updates user scores via their API approximately once per hour, though it can occasionally take longer during peak load.

Each time we fetch an update, we distribute Atto based on the team members’ Folding@Home scores. The calculation works like this:

- **5,000 attos are distributed per minute.**
- If the Folding@Home stats haven’t updated for 60 minutes, we’ll distribute `5,000 × 60 = 300,000 attos`.
- The total amount is **divided proportionally** based on the scores reported by Folding@Home.

So if your machine contributed 10% of the total team score since the last update, you'll receive 10% of the rewards for that round.

Your Atto address (used as your Folding@Home username) is what links your contributions to your wallet—so make sure it’s correct!

Your computer is now helping scientific research—and you're earning Atto in the process.
