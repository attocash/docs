# Mining

Instead of securing the network through energy-intensive calculations, you can earn Atto by contributing your computer’s processing
power to **medical research** via Folding@Home. This isn’t part of Atto’s consensus mechanism—it’s a way to reward users for
**real-world impact**. Every unit of work helps scientific research and supports Atto’s commitment to being **green and sustainable**.

By putting your computing power to good use, we create a fair and meaningful way to **distribute attos** to supporters of valuable causes.

Here’s how to get started:

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Folding@Home

If you haven’t already, download and install Folding@Home.

#### Mac & Windows

Download the client from [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Ubuntu & Debian

```bash
wget https://download.foldingathome.org/releases/public/fah-client/debian-10-64bit/release/fah-client_8.4.9_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i --ignore-depends=policykit-1 fah-client_8.4.9_amd64.deb
```

To ensure the Folding@Home client starts automatically:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now fahclient
```

### Step 2: Create an Account

Go to: https://v8-4.foldingathome.org

Fill out the following fields:
1. Email
2. Passphrase (and Confirm Passphrase)
3. Username — use your Atto account **without** the `atto://` prefix
4. Team — enter `1066107`

<br />
<br />

:::warning
You can change your username and team later, but if you start mining, **incorrect values will prevent you from receiving rewards** for completed work units.
:::

### Step 3: Add a Passkey (Optional but VERY Recommended)

A passkey is a unique 32-character token that links your work to your Folding@Home username. It unlocks the Quick Return Bonus (QRB), which can boost your points by 2× to over 10× if you consistently return work units on time with a success rate of 80% or higher.

#### How to get your passkey (takes less than 30 seconds):

1. Visit [apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey](https://apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey)
2. Enter your Folding@Home username and email address
3. Click **Get Passkey** – the token will be emailed to you
4. Copy the 32-character passkey from the email

#### Add it to your account

Click the gear icon at the top right:

Paste your passkey and save:
<IdealImage img={require('./add-passkey.png')} alt="Screenshot showing where to add your Folding@Home passkey." />

:::warning
Bonus points apply only if you **use a passkey**, complete **10 successful** bonus-eligible WUs (to activate) and
maintain an overall **≥80%** successful WU return rate. **Partial returns do not earn bonus points.**
:::


### Step 4: Start folding

Now it's time to shine! Open the Folding@Home interface and click **Fold All** to begin contributing.
Your computer will start working on a unit of research, which may take some time to complete depending on your hardware and system settings.

You can monitor progress, adjust CPU and GPU usage, and choose whether Folding@Home runs only when your computer is idle or continuously.

:::tip
To maximize your contribution, consider running Folding@Home continuously. You can also enable GPU folding (if supported) to significantly boost your output.
:::

As long as your username and team are correctly configured, your points will be tracked and converted into Atto automatically.

## How Rewards Are Distributed

The system periodically checks Folding@Home scores and distributes rewards for **completed work units**.

When an update is detected, the system calculates the rewards based on the time since the last update:

* **Emissions are allocated per minute at a variable rate `E`** (default **5,000 attos/min**) that can **step up or down weekly** (see policy below).
* If 12 hours (720 minutes) have passed since last update, then `E × 720` attos are distributed in that cycle.
* Example with the default: `5,000 × 720 = 3,600,000 attos`.
* This total is then **split proportionally** among team members, based on the points they contributed during that time (as reported by the Folding@Home stats API).

So if your machine provided 10% of the team’s total contribution, you’d receive 10% of that round’s rewards.

Your Atto address (used as your Folding@Home username) is what links your contribution to your wallet—make sure it's accurate!

### Emission & Price-Stability Policy (Weekly)

To keep Atto **usable as money**, we aim for **stable prices**. We can’t control demand, but we can control **net new supply** (emissions).
Each week we evaluate the **7-day price change** and **adjust the emission step** accordingly:


**Emission ladder (high → low):**
`5,000 → 4,000 → 3,000 → 2,000 → 1,000 → 500 → 250 → 100 attos/min`.


- **If price is down:** for each full **−1%** over the last 7 days, **move down one step** for the next week.
- Example: **−3%** → next week emits **2,000/min** (`5k → 4k → 3k → 2k`).
- **If price is up:** if the 7-day change is **> +1%**, move **up one step** only (slow climb).
- Example: from **2,000/min** and **+3%** → next week **3,000/min**.
- **If price is stable:** between **−1% and +1%**, **no change**.
- **Annual guardrail:** We target roughly **15% of total supply per year** (≈ **1.25%/month** baseline).
If reductions put us behind this pace, emissions may temporarily **exceed 5,000/min** later—**only** when market conditions are stable enough to absorb it.
