You can now earn Atto by contributing your computer‚Äôs processing power to medical research through Folding@Home. Here‚Äôs
how to set it up.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Folding@Home

If you haven‚Äôt already, download and install Folding@Home.

üîó [Official Folding@Home Installation & Account Guide](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/)

    _Example:_ `atto://adwmbykpqs3mgbqogizzwm6arokkcmuxium7rbh343drwd2q5om6vj3jrfiyk`

    ‚û°Ô∏è Use: `adwmbykpqs3mgbqogizzwm6arokkcmuxium7rbh343drwd2q5om6vj3jrfiyk`

## üì§ How Rewards Are Distributed

Folding@Home updates user scores via their API approximately once per hour, though it can occasionally take longer during peak load.

Each time we fetch an update, we distribute Atto based on the team members‚Äô Folding@Home scores. The calculation works like this:

- **5,000 attos are distributed per minute.**
- If the Folding@Home stats haven‚Äôt updated for 60 minutes, we‚Äôll distribute `5,000 √ó 60 = 300,000 attos`.
- The total amount is **divided proportionally** based on the scores reported by Folding@Home.

So if your machine contributed 10% of the total team score since the last update, you'll receive 10% of the rewards for that round.

Your Atto address (used as your Folding@Home username) is what links your contributions to your wallet‚Äîso make sure it‚Äôs correct!
