    question: "Can I use my GPU for Folding@Home?",
    answer:
    "Yes! Folding@Home supports GPU processing for many work units. Using a capable GPU can significantly increase your contribution score compared to using only a CPU."
  },
  {
    question: "How often are Atto rewards distributed?",
    answer:
    "Updates and distributions happen roughly twice a day on average, but timing can vary and is not guaranteed."
  },
  {
    question: "If the updates aren't frequent, do I lose potential rewards?",
    answer:
    "No. Rewards are based on the total time passed since the last cycle and your proportional contribution during that period."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I receive Atto rewards for incomplete Folding@Home Work Units?",
    answer:
    "No. Folding@Home only awards points for fully completed Work Units. Only those contribute to your Atto rewards."
  },
  {
    question: "Can the Atto reward rate (5,000 attos/minute) change?",
    answer:
    "The rate is fixed for now, but it could be adjusted in the future depending on distribution progress and project goals."
