# Reward for Contributions

We're excited to recognize and reward everyone who contributes to our Atto open source projects. Each level below shows the impact your work can have, along with the amount of **Atto** you'll receive as a token of our appreciation. 

**Remember, these rewards aren’t payments—they’re just our way of saying thanks!**

## 1. **Critical Vulnerability**

This level is for **reporting** urgent, critical security issues that threaten the core stability and safety of the ecosystem. Identifying such vulnerabilities requires deep expertise and swift action to ensure the security of Atto.

**IMPORTANT**: Please do not open a public pull request or create an issue in the public issue tracker for security vulnerabilities. To qualify for a reward, report vulnerabilities privately using [this link](https://github.com/attocash/node/security), and wait for us to acknowledge and address the issue before sharing any details publicly.

**Reward**: **1,500,000 units of Atto**

## 2. **Epic**

Epics are big projects that have a huge impact across our repositories. They often involve a lot of planning, coding, and teamwork.

**Reward**: **1,500,000 units of Atto**

## 3. **Major**

Major tasks are significant changes or new features that play an important role in making our projects better. They’re not as large as an Epic, but still require solid effort and skill.

**Reward**: **400,000 units of Atto**

## 4. **Minor**

Minor tasks are small improvements or bug fixes that help make the projects smoother and more reliable. They might not be huge, but they add up.

**Reward**: **100,000 units of Atto**

---

## 5. **Tweak**

Tweaks are quick, small adjustments like UI updates or optimizations. They may be minor, but they help make the project feel more complete.

**Note**: The reward levels are just guidelines, and the actual tier of your contribution will be decided by the maintainers. Reward amounts may change over time, but we will always consider the date of your contribution or report when determining the final reward. No matter the size, every contribution counts, and we deeply appreciate all your efforts. We’ll evaluate each contribution and assign it to the tier we think fits best. Thanks for all your help in making Atto better!
