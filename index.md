# Official Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Atto!

Atto is a fast, feeless, and scalable digital currency, created from the ground up to be practical for everyday,
real-world transactions. Our goal is to create a digital cash that is as easy and efficient to use as physical cash, but
with the global reach and security of a decentralized network.

What makes Atto unique is its approach to both its technology and its distribution. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies,
Atto has zero transaction fees, making it ideal for payments of any size. Furthermore, new Atto coins are not mined in
the traditional sense. Instead, they are distributed to users who contribute their spare computing power to the
Folding@home project, a distributed computing network that supports groundbreaking scientific research into diseases
like Alzheimer's and cancer.

This documentation is your central resource for understanding every aspect of the Atto ecosystem. Here, we provide the
knowledge and tools for you to learn, build, and participate:

* **For a deep dive into the technology,** start with our foundational [**Whitepaper**](/docs/whitepaper). It covers the
  core principles, consensus model, and the innovative design that makes Atto possible.
* **To learn how to earn Atto,** explore our guides on joining the [**Folding@home**](/docs/mining) effort and how our
  reward system works.
* **To get involved in the project,** see our section on [**Contribution Rewards**](/docs/reward-for-contributions) to
  find out how you can lend your skills to our growing community and be recognized for it.

We believe in building a transparent, community-driven project. We're excited you're here to learn more and hope you'll
join us in building the future of digital cash.
