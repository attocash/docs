# Staking

<StakingContent>

Earn rewards by helping secure and decentralize the Atto network. Simply delegate your balance to a [voter](/explorer/voters) and receive **daily payouts** based on the current APY.

**Current rates:** The effective APY is **<Metric name="distribution.staking.annual-percentage-yield.effective" suffix="%" />** (base <Metric name="distribution.staking.annual-percentage-yield" suffix="%" /> × <Metric name="distribution.growth-stability-index" suffix="" /> [GSI](/docs/growth-stability-index)). Each voter decides how much of the APY they will share with you.

## Why Stake?

- **Earn passive income**: Generate returns on your Atto holdings with daily payouts
- **Support decentralization**: By choosing diverse voters, you help distribute network power
- **Strengthen the network**: Active stakers contribute to network security and consensus

## How to Start Staking

1. **Get Atto**: Ensure you have at least **$10 USD worth** of Atto in your wallet
2. **Choose a Voter**: In your wallet, select a voter that shows an APY percentage ([browse active voters](/explorer/voters))
3. **Stay Active**: Make at least one transaction every 30 days to remain eligible
4. **Receive Funds**: Log into your wallet regularly to receive any pending transactions

## How Rewards Are Calculated

### Effective Balance

Your rewards are based on your **effective balance**:

- The **average of your daily balances** over the past 30 days
- Capped at your **current balance** (you can't earn on funds you no longer hold)

This rewards consistent holders and prevents gaming the system by briefly inflating balances.

### Daily Reward Formula

```
Daily Reward = Effective Balance × Daily APY Rate
```

Where:

```
Daily APY Rate = (1 + Annual APY)^(1/365) - 1
```

### Voter Cap

To promote decentralization, each voter has a **cap of 180 million Atto** in total delegated balance. If exceeded, rewards are proportionally reduced for all delegators to that voter.

**Tip:** Choose voters with lower total delegation for potentially better reward rates.

### GSI Influence

The effective APY is adjusted daily based on the [Growth Stability Index (GSI)](/docs/growth-stability-index). During favorable market conditions the APY may be higher; during bearish conditions it adjusts downward to maintain price stability.

## Payout Schedule

Rewards are **paid out once per day**. The system calculates rewards for the previous day and distributes them to all eligible accounts automatically.
