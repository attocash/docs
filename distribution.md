# Distribution

Atto's total supply of 18 billion tokens was created at genesis—no new tokens can ever be minted. However, these tokens enter circulation gradually through various distribution programs, each designed to grow the network while maintaining stability.

Distribution rates are dynamically adjusted using the [Growth Stability Index (GSI)](/docs/growth-stability-index), which responds to market conditions to balance adoption with price stability.

## Distribution Programs

### Faucet

The [faucet](/faucet) allows anyone to claim free Atto instantly. It's the simplest way for newcomers to start using the network without any investment or technical setup.

### Mining (Folding@Home)

Through our [Folding@Home integration](/docs/mining), users earn Atto by contributing computing power to medical research. This program rewards meaningful work while distributing tokens to active participants.

### Staking

Voters who help secure the network through [Open Representative Voting](/docs/whitepaper#consensus-mechanism-open-representative-voting) receive staking rewards. Running a voter node and accumulating delegated weight makes you eligible for ongoing distributions. See the [staking voter guide](/blog/how-to-host-a-staking-voter) to get started.

### Contribution Rewards

Community members who contribute to Atto earn rewards based on impact:

- Software development and code contributions
- Critical vulnerability reporting
- Documentation, tutorials, and educational content
- Community support and outreach

For details, see [Rewards for Contributions](/docs/reward-for-contributions).
